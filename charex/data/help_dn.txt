SYNOPSIS
    dn {form} {base} [{maxdepth}]

DESCRIPTION
    The parameters are as follows:
    
    form        The Unicode normalization form for the denormalization.
                The valid values are: NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD.

    base        The string to denormalize.

    maxdepth    (Optional.) How many denormalizations to use per character.
                This can be used to reduce the number of denormalizations
                for a string into a manageable subset of the total number
                of denormalizations.
