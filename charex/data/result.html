        <p>Search Error</p>
        <p>Your search could not be completed because this is an example
        for a presentation, and I didn't want to bother with actually
        creating search functionality. I just needed something that looks
        like an error and reflects some data I sent it. Our apologies for
        the inconvenience.</p>
        <p>The search string was: {}</p>
