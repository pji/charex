`charex` is a Unicode and character set explorer for understanding
issues with character set translation and Unicode normalization.


Why Did I Make This?
====================
I find the ambiguity of text data interesting. In memory its all ones
and zeros. There is nothing inherent to the data that makes `0x20` mean
a space character, but we've mostly agreed that it does. That "mostly"
part is what's interesting to me, and where a lot of fun problems lie.


How Do I Use This?
==================
It's still early in development, so there isn't really anything very
useful yet.
